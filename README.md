# TicTacToe
Unity implementation of classic Tic Tac Toe game.

Unity version: 2017.3.0f3

This is a single player game. 

AI is built using HashSet data structure. Next I will use same logic to improve validation of game logic.

The cells are implemented using unity 2d sprites. Each cell is represented as an element in a single dimensional List.
